# SchoolClass-Calculator
A tool to find which period
your in at school :D

The link is:
https://faraday22.github.io/SchoolClass-Calculator/

# How to use
At the bottom of the website you'll see
a button, once you click it, it will
Tell you how much time is left and what period your in

# If you clone or want to use
Note this is made as a public project 
for the school I go to
so the time will not be exact in JS to yours. I may implement in the future with cookies to save your school schedule
so it works for everyone. But until then
understand by default the javascript
may not work for you.

# How to report a bug
